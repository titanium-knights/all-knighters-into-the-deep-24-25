         *    - Control points manipulate the curve between the start and end points.
         *    - A good visualizer for this is [this](https://pedro-path-generator.vercel.app/).
         *    * BezierLines are straight, and require 2 points. There are the start and end points.
         * Paths have can have heading interpolation: Constant, Linear, or Tangential
         *    * Linear heading interpolation:
         *    - Pedro will slowly change the heading of the robot from the startHeading to the endHeading over the course of the entire path.
         *    * Constant Heading Interpolation:
         *    - Pedro will maintain one heading throughout the entire path.
         *    * Tangential Heading Interpolation:
         *    - Pedro will follows the angle of the path such that the robot is always driving forward when it follows the path.
         * PathChains hold Path(s) within it and are able to hold their end point, meaning that they will holdPoint until another path is followed.
