         *    - Pedro will slowly change the heading of the robot from the startHeading to the endHeading over the course of the entire path.
         *    * Constant Heading Interpolation:
         *    - Pedro will maintain one heading throughout the entire path.
         *    * Tangential Heading Interpolation:
         *    - Pedro will follows the angle of the path such that the robot is always driving forward when it follows the path.
